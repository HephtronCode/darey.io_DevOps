# Datawise AWS Automation Project with Shell Scripting

*Project Requirement Summary:*
The goal of this project is to *develop an automated shell script* that sets up AWS resources for a data science workspace. This script must efficiently deploy *EC2 instances for computation* and *S3 buckets for data storage*, integrating five key shell scripting concepts:
1. *Functions:* Modularize tasks such as provisioning EC2 instances, configuring S3 buckets, and verifying deployments.
2. *Arrays:* Store and track created resources efficiently, allowing easy retrieval and manipulation.
3. *Environment Variables:* Securely handle sensitive data like AWS credentials, region settings, and configuration parameters.
4. *Command Line Arguments:* Allow customization by accepting parameters such as instance types and bucket names at runtime.
5. *Error Handling:* Implement robust mechanisms to detect and resolve AWS service exceptions, ensuring reliability.
### *Business Context:*
The script is being developed for *DataWise Solutions*, a data science consulting company, to support its *e-commerce client* in setting up cloud-based analytical tools. The client aims to use AWS services to analyze customer interactions and improve their shopping experience.
### *Purpose of This Mini-Project:*
This phase ensures that you *fully understand* the project requirements before moving on to implementation. Your submission should clearly articulate what the project entails based on the outlined objectives.
